# NPlusPlusAssistant

N++ Assistant helps with backups and installing community mod stuff for the videogame [N++](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/). Only for the Steam Windows version.

Needs Visual Studio Community 2019 with C# .Net stuff installed to compile from source.

## Stuff it already does:

* autodetect main game asset folders (list them with explorer path link)

* backup profile, editor levels, replays, sounds, palettes and game levels

* detect if npp is running (avoid install / uninstall while running)

* list all profiles on backup and select one to replace current one or delete

* list metanet palettes (auto download from discord link) and select which to install

* list community palettes (from google spreadsheet) and select which to install

* list all palettes on backup and select one to install or delete

## Stuff it'll eventually do:

* display maximum palette install count

* link to online palette editor

* download soundpacks and select one to replace the current one

* download metanet maps pack and select one to put on your map levels editor folder (for practice / remixes)

* install/revert community map packs

* edit nppconf (useful for troubleshooting some launch problems)

* have an n++ icon

* display nprofile road to 100% completion details / corruption checks
